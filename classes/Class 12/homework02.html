    <h1>Three Ways to Insert CSS</h1>
    <p>There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>External CSS</li>
        <li>Internal CSS</li>
        <li>Inline CSS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>

    <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS</h2>
    <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.</p>

    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with
        presentation). Use this method sparingly.</p>

    <h3>Cascading Order</h3>
    <p>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?</p>
    <p>All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one
        has the highest priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inline style (inside an HTML element)</li>
        <li>External and internal style sheets (in the head section)</li>
        <li>Browser default</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.</p>
