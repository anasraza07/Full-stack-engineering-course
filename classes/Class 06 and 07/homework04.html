    <h1>Difference b/w article and section tag</h1>
    <p>The main difference between the article and section tags in HTML is that the article tag is used for independent content, while the section tag is used for grouping related content. Both the article and section tags are semantic elements that help to structure and understand content on a web page. They can improve accessibility for screen reader users and SEO by providing search engines with clear cues about the content's structure and purpose.</p>
    <p>You can nest an article tag inside a section tag, or use it on its own.</p>
    <h2>Article tag</h2>
        <p>Used to describe a self-contained piece of content that can be reused or distributed independently. Like YouTube use to contain different kinds of videos on a single page, each video is independent. Article tags are perfect for Microdata information. For example,
        you can use the article tag for blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.</p>
        <h2>Section tag</h2>
        <p>Used to group related sections of content together. This tag is used to split a page into sections like Introduction, Contact Information, Details, etc and each of these sections can be in a different &lt;section&gt; tag. The &lt;section&gt; tag is introduced to wrap-up the things in a particular section. A section can have nested sections. For example, you can use the section tag to group a group of
        blog entries together.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Placing &lt;article&gt; tag inside of &lt;section&gt; tag is good practice, like section basically defines the types and the articles will contain the specific contents in that type of section. </p>
