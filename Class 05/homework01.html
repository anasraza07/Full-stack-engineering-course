    <h1>h1 ko apne poore page main kitni baar use kr skte hain?</h1>
    <p>You can use H1 tags as often as you want on a page. There is no limit, neither upper nor lower bound. There can
        be some instances where using multiple H1 tags on a webpage makes sense.</p>
    <p>BUT BUT BUT</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Here are some best practices for using H1 tags:</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Use one H1 tag per page to help search engines and visitors understand the page's main topic.</li>
        <li>Use multiple H2 tags to divide your content into sections that are easy for users to skim.</li>
        <li>Too many H1 tags can confuse both users and search engines about the content's priority.</li>
    </ul>
